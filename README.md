# Internship project

The following github repository will be used to collect the whole documentation for my internship project. The aim of this project is to create an alternative to expensive data diode technology using free, open source software and two Raspoberry Pi machines connected to each other via serial cable. The repository currently is structed in two main folders, one is the documentation folder built in Latex, where I am documenting a full guide on how to get the project running, and documenting my steps, and the other with the two actual files. 

### To do list:
- [x] Communication between two machines.
- [x] File Transmission.
- [x] Checksum to check for correct file transmission.
- [x] Increased file size.
- [ ] Increased transmission speeds.
- [ ] Stress test.
- [ ] Ease of use by allowing the program to be run for any filename.
- [ ] RTS/CTS implementation
